Ideas:
  - hex: different rendering style?
  - expose rendering settings (thickness, scale, etc)
  - also generate entry/exit at random?
  - weave mazes? (how?)
  - onedirectional edges? (note: this requires updating Wilson's algorithm)
  - SVG instead of Canvas rendering? Facilitates further editing e.g in inkscape.
